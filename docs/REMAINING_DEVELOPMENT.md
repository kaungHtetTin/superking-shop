# LaLaPick — Remaining Development Jobs

A actionable backlog of work still needed to reach MVP and full product-spec coverage.  
Use this alongside [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) (high-level phases) and [`project_specification.md`](./project_specification.md) (full vision).

**Last updated:** June 9, 2026

---

## Progress snapshot

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Phases 1–4 (foundation, auth, catalog, orders) | **Done** |
| Phase 2 staff management | **Done** (Super Admin CRUD at `/admin/users`) |
| Admin UI (glass kit) | **Done** for shell + main pages |
| Phase 5 loyalty & coupons | **Not started** (DB tables only) |
| Phase 5 recommendations | **Partial** |
| Phase 6 chat | **Partial** (polling UI; no Echo/Pusher) |
| Phase 7 i18n / storefront dark mode / perf | **Mostly open** |
| Phase 8 deployment | **Not started** |

**Estimated remaining effort:** ~4–6 focused development sprints (depends on scope of analytics, payments, and i18n).

---

## Priority order (recommended)

1. **Phase 5 — Loyalty & coupons** (tables exist; high business value)
2. **Phase 6 — Real-time chat upgrade** (UI exists; wire broadcasting)
3. **Phase 7 — Polish** (i18n, storefront dark mode, performance)
4. **Spec gaps** (review moderation, reports, audit logs)
5. **Phase 8 — Production launch**

---

## Document maintenance

When completing a job:

1. Check the box or remove the row in this file.  
2. Update [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) phase status.  
3. Add implementation notes to the relevant spec (`ProductManagement.md`, `ADMIN_USER_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`, etc.) if behavior changes.
